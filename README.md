When combined with "webscraping," the term "webscrap-LLM" could refer to the process of utilizing large language models (LLMs) like GPT to parse, analyze, or make sense of data obtained through web scraping. This combination might involve using language models to process, interpret, or generate insights from the extracted data obtained via web scraping techniques.

For instance, after collecting data from various websites using web scraping, large language models could be applied to analyze this data, extract meaningful information, summarize content, categorize data, perform sentiment analysis, generate reports, or assist in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks based on the scraped information.
